# Azure-Blob-Storage-Deduplication
This project provides a Python script for deduplicating blobs within an Azure Blob Storage container. Using SHA-256 hashing, the script identifies duplicate blobs and prompts the user to delete them interactively. It offers an efficient way to manage storage and ensure data redundancy removal within Azure Blob Storage environments.
